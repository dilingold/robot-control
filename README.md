# robot-control
This is an assignment I completed for a java programming course. The instructor provided us with the robot GUI and listener, our job was to move the robot hand around the selected bar heights. Extra credit was assigned to students who managed to move the robot hand around in the least amount of moves, which I of course completed :)
